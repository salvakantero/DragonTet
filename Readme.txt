The objective of DragonTet is to move, rotate, and place falling pieces to form complete horizontal lines on the game board.
Whenever you complete a line, it disappears, clearing space on the board and increasing your score.
After completing a certain number of lines, the game level increases. With each level, the speed of the falling pieces increases, making the game more challenging.
From level 4 onwards, completing multiple lines at once will generate trap blocks on the board.
If the pieces stack up to the top of the board and you cannot place any more, the game is over!

Single-Player Mode:
  Compete to achieve the highest score possible.

Two-Player Mode (Optional):
  Each player has their own game board.
  The winner is the one who survives the longest or achieves the highest score.
  Any trap blocks generated will be transferred to the opponent's board.
